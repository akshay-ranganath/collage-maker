To use the code, we need a few setup. 

* Create an unsigned upload preset such that it can tag the uploaded images.
* Edit `index.html` and enter the following:
 * `cloudName`: This should be your cloud name.
 * `uploadPreset`: This should be the unsigned upload preset you created in the previous step.
* Upload a set of images and tag them as _background_.

That's it. You should be set and able to work with the code.
