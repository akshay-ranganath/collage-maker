## Background

Creating a collage is always an interesting way to group images. It is makes sharing more fun and helps create memories. There are a number of tools out there that does the job very well.

The motivation for this project is to show a method to help create collage using Cloudinary. Personally, it was an effort to learn some advanced implementation techniques like using [variables](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/user_defined_variables), [unsigned upload](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/ios_image_and_video_upload#unsigned_upload) and [tagging](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/additional_upload_api_options#tagging_assets) through an [incoming transformation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/transformations_on_upload#incoming_transformations).
